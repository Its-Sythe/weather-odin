# weather-odin

## A super basic really simple weather app.

The app utilizes visual crossing weather api and was a project undertaken to
familiarize myself with APIs all in all it was a good practice run.

There are many other features that I could add onto the app itself, I would like
if I could just keep it simple as is.

The app offers a way to let you know what the weather condition is and what the
temperature on that day is like. Would be ideal to make it load with one place everytime.
